ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS/CREDITS
------------------------

Much of the code here got a running start thanks to the Commerce PayPal and Sage
payment modules so thank you to the authors ikos and rszrama. Also thanks to the
Ubercart uc_worldpay author Hans Idink and psynaptic as that module also gave me
a running start on working with WorldPay's API.
